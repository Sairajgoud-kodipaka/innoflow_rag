| chore    | Routine tasks, dependency updates                       |

### Formatting Rules

- Start with a capital letter
- Keep messages concise (max 72 characters)
- No periods at the end
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### Examples


feat: Add agent builder interface
fix: Resolve issue with sidebar navigation
docs: Update flow editor documentation
style: Improve dark mode contrast


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Fill out the pull request template completely
4. Request a review from at least one maintainer
5. Address any review comments
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### PR Title Format

Follow the same format as commit messages:


feat: Implement drag-and-drop for flow nodes


## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for props and state
- Use proper type annotations

### React

- Use functional components and hooks
- Follow composition patterns over inheritance
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper component file naming:
  - Component files: PascalCase.tsx (e.g., FlowEditor.tsx)
  - Utility files: kebab-case.ts (e.g., use-flow-state.ts)

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the color scheme defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Ensure responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for tests. To run tests:

bash
npm run test
# or
pnpm test


### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new components and features
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Test actual user behavior, not implementation details
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Documentation

- Document all new components with JSDoc comments
- Update the README.md when adding significant features
- For user-facing features, add appropriate documentation in the /docs section

## Community

- Join our Discord server for discussions
- Ask questions in GitHub issues
- Participate in code reviews
