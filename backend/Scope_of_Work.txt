Scope of Work: InnoFlow
Project Overview
 This project involves the development of a web-based application that provides an intuitive visual interface for building and deploying AI-powered workflows. The application will support drag-and-drop functionality, seamless integration with AI models, and a user-friendly experience.
 Objectives:
•	Develop a fully functional Langflow clone with a similar UI/UX.
•	Enable drag-and-drop workflow creation.
•	Implement backend processing for AI model execution.
•	Ensure seamless API integration for AI and ML models.
•	Provide user authentication and role-based access.
•	Optimize performance for smooth real-time interactions.
 Features:
1.	Frontend Development:
 Develop a responsive UI using React.js.
 Implement drag-and-drop functionality using libraries like React Flow or D3.js.
 Design intuitive node-based workflow creation.
 Provide real-time collaboration features (optional).
 Implement interactive visual elements to enhance the user experience.
 Enable users to customize workflows with configurable nodes and parameters.
 Implement auto-save functionality to prevent data loss.
2.	Backend Development
 Implement Flask or Django or FastAPI as the backend framework.
 Develop API endpoints for workflow execution and management.
 Integrate with OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama, or other ML services.
 Implement a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB or SQLite) for storing workflows and user data.
 Optimize backend processing to ensure efficient execution of AI models.
 Implement logging and monitoring for debugging and system insights.
3.	Authentication & User Management
 Implement JWT-based authentication.
 Provide role-based access control (admin, user, guest).
 Enable third-party authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.).
 Implement session management and token expiration handling.
 Enable email verification and password recovery functionalities.
 Allow users to manage profile settings and access permissions.
4.	Workflow & AI Integration
 Allow users to connect AI models and preprocess data.
 Support execution of workflows with real-time feedback.
 Provide integration with APIs for AI models.
 Implement a modular plugin system to extend AI capabilities.
5.	Additional Features
 Implement a version control system for workflows.
 Provide detailed analytics and reporting on workflow performance.
 Enable users to share and collaborate on workflows.
 Implement a marketplace for pre-built AI workflow templates.
 Provide an in-app documentation and tutorial system.
